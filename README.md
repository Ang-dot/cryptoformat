`cryptoformat` is used by coingecko.com to format crypto and fiat values.

Often an altcoin can be worth much less than $0.01 USD, and thus we need to format this value by providing more decimal places in the formatting to prevent losing precious information.

`cryptoformat` also tries to handle different locales and currency formatting by deferring the work to the browser's [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NumberFormat)

## Install

```
npm i @coingecko/cryptoformat
```

## Usage

```
import { formatCurrency } from "@coingecko/cryptoformat";

formatCurrency(123, "USD", "en")
// "$123.00"

formatCurrency(0.00123, "USD", "en")
// "$0.00123000"

// Provide raw = true to remove formatting and symbol
formatCurrency(0.00123, "USD", "en", true)
// "0.00123000"

formatCurrency(123400, "IDR", "id")
// "Rp123.400"

formatCurrency(123400, "EUR", "de")
// "123.400 â‚¬"
```

## Issues

`Intl.NumberFormat` does not always behave consistently across browsers. `cryptoformat` does some manual overrides in order to ensure that "MYR123.00" is displayed as "RM123.00", for example. Unfortunately given that country detection for locale is quite hard to do, e.g. "en-MY", `cryptoformat` can only rely on "en" but this means that currency symbol formatting can differ from what an average user may expect.
